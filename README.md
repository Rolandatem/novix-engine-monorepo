# NovixEngine

Angular monorepo housing **NovixEngine**, a lightweight toolset for front-end theming, utilities, and components.  
Designed for clarity, extensibility, and developer onboarding, NovixEngine embraces conventions inspired by Bootstrap syntax and Angular best practices.

This monorepo includes:
- `novix-engine`: The core library (in active development)
- `demo-app`: A showcase and testing ground for NovixEngine components

> NovixEngine is currently a work in progress.  
> For component documentation, usage examples, and API details, see the [NovixEngine README](./projects/novix-engine/README.md).
